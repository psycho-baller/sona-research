# What it does
If you're a UCalgary student and taking PSYC 200,201,203? This could be helpful for you.

When you run this code it will automatically check for u if there is a study up, and if there is, it will show you the study description and how many credits you will gain from taking it.

Then, you will be asked weather you want to take this study or not. If there is more than one study available, it will show you the decription of the other study once you decline the previous study.

If you've accepted a study, you will be asked weather you want to start working on the study or not (if it's an online study).

Please [connect with me](#connect-with-me) if you have any good ideas to improve this project in any way.

# Setup
Firstly, you will need to install python and have Google Chrome in your PC, I will add the ability to use Firefox instead of Chrome soon. You can install the latest version of python with the help of <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">this</a> tutorial or <a href="https://youtu.be/Kn1HF3oD19c" target="_blank">this</a> tutorial. Make sure you've installed pip while installing python.

Next, you'll have to install 3 packages: Selenium, Webdriver Manager, and BeautifulSoup.

To install these packages, go to your command prompt (search 'cmd' and you'll find the application) and type:

`pip install selenium`

`pip install webdriver-manager`

`pip install bs4`

Then, you can either install the zip file [here](https://github.com/psycho-baller/UCalgary-research-participation/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or clone the repository or simply copy paste the [main.py](https://github.com/psycho-baller/UCalgary-research-participation/blob/master/main.py) code to your own .py file

Finally, before running the [main.py](https://github.com/psycho-baller/UCalgary-research-participation/blob/master/main.py) file, insert your USER ID and password in line 25 and 26 respectively between the single quotation marks.

# Future plans
It is far from being done, I'm still making changes to the code.

The program takes around 10-15 seconds to check if there's a study currently, There is a way where it can take just a few seconds but I was unable to make it work, maybe I will try again when I take PSYC 203.
